## Setup

- Clone the github repository first using git:

  git clone https://github.com/fazle-elahi-tonmoy/pickpocket-security-system.git
  ```


## Problem Statement:
Pickpocketing has been a wide-spread problem throughout the entire world. In Bangladesh there happens at least 9 thefts per 100,000 people which is very agitating <<a href = "https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Bangladesh/theft/"> source here </a>

So, we created a very low-cost security device which will alert the user if someone tries to pick-pocket their wallet or other valuable stuff. 

## Description:
The product consists of a single PCB containing IR reflective sensor, buzzer, and a microcontroller which can trigger if someone pulls the moneybag out of the pocket without consent and create a huge sound indicating theft. 
It can also be attached to smartphone and be put into the pocket because of its slim design.
