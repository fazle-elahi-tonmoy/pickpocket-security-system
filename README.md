# pickpocket-security-system

## Setup

- Clone the github repository first using git:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/fazle-elahi-tonmoy/pickpocket-security-system.git
  ```


## Problem Statement:
Pickpocketing has been a wide-spread problem throughout the entire world. In Bangladesh there happens at least 9 thefts per 100,000 people which is very agitating <a href = "https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Bangladesh/theft/"> source here </a>

So, we created a very low-cost security device which will alert the user if someone tries to pick-pocket their wallet or other valuable stuff. 

## Description:
The product consists of a single PCB containing IR reflective sensor, buzzer, and a microcontroller which can trigger if someone pulls the moneybag out of the pocket without consent and create a huge sound indicating theft. 
It can also be attached to smartphone and be put into the pocket because of its slim design.

## Working Principle:
  In this product there is a single push button for activating the system and setting your password. First, letâ€™s see the way to press this button:
  
  - <img src="img/Short Press.png" width="50" > Short Press (Press and Release Immediately)
  - <img src="img/Long Press.png" width="50" > Long Press (Press and hold for at least 0.5s)

  Now there is three major modes in this device. Each mode has a specific button pressing sequence which are described below:
